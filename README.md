# Papers-Continual-RL
I am constantly collecting papers on Continual Reinforcement Learning on high-profile ML conferences or journals. Although the theoretical foundations of continual RL is not clear, it is still a valuable research field in addressing the challenges in the non-stationary environments for RL algorithms.
